trsdump can be used to parse and extract information from a .trs file.

REQUIREMENTS:
To compile trsdump you will need at least:
- vala compiler (0.16 has been tested)
  - gcc
  - pkg-config
  - glib
- libarchive (0.26 has been tested)
- libxml2
- make
- sox
- awk

COMPILATION:
Just type make.

USAGE:
Help is available by supplying -h option.
The Makefile contains useful examples of usage: if you add .trs files
to the INPUT_TRS_FILES variable, they will be processed by this tool.
The output from the tool will be used to split files (using sox and
awk) into three different test sets composed by small audio files.
